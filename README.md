# Congratulations!

Congratulations for making it to this part of the interview process. To get a hands-on idea of your current skillset and to (perhaps more importantly) provide you with an opportunity to experience a taste of the type of work that this role will concern itself with, we'd like for you to perform two straightforward programming exercises.

In both cases, given that it's top of mind for most people, we'll be dealing with COVID vaccination data and determining if a given patient has been fully vaccinated. That said, we want to be very clear on two important points:

1. HealthMine does not endores a specific COVID vaccination strategy or regimen. Those are highly individual and personal decisions and should be made with the input from, and support of, your primary care provider.
2. We do not expect you to understand the clinical domain in order to be successful in this exercise. We've made every attempt to abstract the details away, but if you have any questions about anything, please... please... ask.

# Basic CLI Program

Create a basic CLI program in any language that accepts some inputs from a set of files and generates some output. See `Exercise.CLI.md` in your Markdown viewer of choice for more information.

# SQL Query

Effectively duplicate Basic CLI Program, but as a single SQL query. See `Exercise.SQL.md`  in your Markdown viewer of choice for more information.

# Solution Submission

To submit, just combine all of your work (compilable program and single composed query) into a single archive (zip, tar, etc.) and email the archive to jason.cone@healthmine.com. We're not picky about file organization - just don't make it too difficult for us to identify what's what.

Once we've had a chance to review your work, we'll be in touch to discuss next steps.
